Summary: 

I finally bit the bullet and got myself an 8-core 4 GHz AMD FX-8350 gamer machine with 16 GB RAM (upgradeable up to 32 GB, which I plan to do so, someday), as I'm getting more and more serious with machine learning. <!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY --> I've stucked in scikit-learn out-of-memory error a couple of times, and using Amazon EC2 cluster is not always the most efficient way to go (plus the additional stress of having to look constantly at the hourâ€¦). 

For doing embarassingly parallel computation stuff, such as training a Random Forest, or computing cross-validation scores for different samples/subsets of a dataset, having a lot of CPUs is clearly an advantage. scikit-learn makes it really easy to parallelize these kinds of computation (most of the time it's just a matter of setting the parameter `n_jobs=-1`).

So the plan is to build on this 8-core machine a computing server to which I can SSH and build my machine learning models using IPython notebook. I'll share here  the steps to quickly build such a system.

####Install Ubuntu server (ca. 30 min) 

Because graphical desktops are gimmicks.

####Download and install Anaconda Python distribution (ca. 10 min)

From [here](http://www.continuum.io/downloads).

####Configure notebook server (ca. 10 min)

**Create a hashed password**

{% include_code ipython_password lang:python %}

**Create an SSL certificate**, from the command line `$ openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:1024 -keyout mycert.pem -out mycert.pem`

**Create IPython notebook profile**, from the command line `$ ipython profile create nbserver`

**Edit the profile's configuration file**

{% include_code ipython_config lang:python %}

And that's it! Now I can SSH to the machine, cd to the folder where I'll do my analyses, and start IPython notebook server: `$ ipython notebook --profile=nbserver`. Then fire up the notebook from a remote web browser. The URL to use is `https://[server's IP address]:[port number]`. Note the https. 

Using IPython makes it even easy to add more *computers* in the network to form a cluster using IPython.parallel. But that would be a topic for another post.
